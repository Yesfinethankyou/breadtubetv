# Contributing

Thank you so much for helping us build an open platform for simplifying the sharing of the massively important content coming out of the B R E A D T U B E movement.

We're looking for any help you can offer, including advising us on what playlists we should put together, but definitely not limited to that.

We'd like more input from other to expand on these guidelines, for now check out the README https://github.com/breadtubetv/breadtubetv/#breadtubetv

The issues section is a great place to add ideas about expanding the platform https://github.com/breadtubetv/breadtubetv/issues

You can also visit the website to find our Discord and other platforms and reach out to them.

Thank you
