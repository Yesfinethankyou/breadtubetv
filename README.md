# [BreadTube.tv](https://breadtube.tv)

This project aims to list anti-establishment public YouTubers for simplified onboarding of new members to the cause.

Growing from that base we want to build a platform which elevates content creators far beyond what YouTube can currently offer, and gives them resiliance from being censored or deplatformed.

For now though this is a *_really simple_* website, links can be added to the homepage under `data/links.yml` and navigation under `config.toml`.
